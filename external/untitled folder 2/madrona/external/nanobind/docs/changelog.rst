Changelog
#########

nanobind uses a `semantic versioning <http://semver.org>`__ policy for its API.
It also has a separate ABI version that is *not* subject to semantic
versioning.

The ABI version is relevant whenever a type binding from one extension module
should be visible in another (also nanobind-based) extension module. In this
case, both modules must use the same nanobind ABI version, or they will be
isolated from each other. Releases that don't explicitly mention an ABI version
below inherit that of the preceding release.

Version 1.9.0 (TBA)
-------------------

* Nothing yet

Version 1.8.0 (Nov 2, 2023)
---------------------------

* nanobind now considers two C++ ``std::type_info`` instances to be equal when
  their mangled names match. The previously used pointer comparison was fast
  but fragile and often caused multi-part extensions to not recognize each
  other's types. This version introduces a two-level caching scheme (search by
  pointer, then by name) to fix such problems once and for all, while avoiding
  the cost of constantly comparing very long mangled names. (commit `b515b1
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/b515b1f7f2f4ecc0357818e6201c94a9f4cbfdc2>`__).

* Fixed casting of complex-valued constant :cpp:class:`nb::ndarray\<T\>
  <ndarray>` instances. (PR `#338
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/338>`__, commit `ba8c7f
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/ba8c7fa55f2d0ad748cad1dd4af2b22979ebc46a>`__).

* Added a type caster for ``std::nullopt_t`` (PR `#350
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/350>`__).

* Added the missing C++ â†’ Python portion of the type caster for
  ``Eigen::Ref<..>`` (PR `#334
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/334>`__).

* Minor fixes and improvements.

* ABI version 12.


Version 1.7.0 (Oct 19, 2023)
----------------------------

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The nd-array class :cpp:class:`nb::ndarray\<T\> <ndarray>` now supports
  complex-valued ``T`` (e.g., ``std::complex<double>``). For this, the header
  file ``nanobind/stl/complex.h`` must be included. (PR `#319
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/319>`__, commit `6cbd13
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/6cbd1387753ea8f519ac0fe2242f0a54dd670ede>`__).

* Added the function :cpp:func:`nb::del() <del>`, which takes an arbitrary
  accessor object as input and tries to delete the associated entry.
  The C++ statement

  .. code-block:: cpp

     nb::del(o[key]);

  is equivalent to ``del o[key]`` in Python. (commit `4dd745
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/4dd74596ac7b0f850cb0144f42a438124b91720c>`__).

* Exposed several convenience functions for raising exceptions as public API:
  :cpp:func:`nb::raise <raise>`, :cpp:func:`nb::raise_type_error
  <raise_type_error>`, and :cpp:func:`nb::raise_python_error
  <raise_python_error>`. (commit `0b7f3b
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/0b7f3b1d2a182bda8b95826a3f98cc3e2d0402db>`__).

* Added :cpp:func:`nb::globals() <globals>`. (PR `#311
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/311>`__, commit `f0a9eb
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/f0a9ebd9cd384ac554312247526b120102563e53>`__).

* The ``char*`` type caster now accepts ``nullptr`` and converts it into a
  Python ``None`` object. (PR `#318
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/317>`__, commit `30a6ba
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/30a6bac97a89bfafad82c2c5b6ef4516c00c35d6>`__).

* Added the function :cpp:func:`nb::is_alive() <is_alive>`, which returns
  ``false`` when nanobind was destructed by Python (e.g., during interpreter
  shutdown) making further use of the API illegal. (commit `b431d0
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/b431d040f7b0585e9901856ee6c9b72281a37fa8>`__).

* Minor fixes and improvements.

* ABI version 11.

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

* The behavior of the :cpp:class:`nb::keep_alive\<Nurse, Patient\>
  <keep_alive>` function binding annotation was changed as follows: when the
  function call requires the implicit conversion of an argument, the lifetime
  constraint now applies to the newly produced argument instead of the original
  object. The change was rolled into a minor release since the former behavior
  is arguably undesirable and dangerous. (commit `9d4b2e
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/9d4b2e317dbf32efab4ed41b6c275f9dbbbcf29f>`__).

* STL type casters previously raised an exception when casting a Python container
  containing a ``None`` element into a C++ container that was not able to
  represent ``nullptr`` (e.g., ``std::vector<T>`` instead of
  ``std::vector<T*>``). However, this exception was raised in a context where
  exceptions were not allowed, causing the process to be ``abort()``-ed, which
  is very bad. This issue is now fixed, and such conversions are refused. (PR
  `#318 <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/318>`__, commits `d1ad3b
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/d1ad3b91346a1566f42fdf194a3ed9c3eeec5858>`__
  and `5f25ae
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/5f25ae0eb9691fbe03a20bcb9f604277ccc1884b>`__).

* The STL sequence casters (``std::vector<T>``, etc.) now refuse to unpack
  ``str`` and ``bytes`` objects analogous to pybind11. (commit `7e4a88
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/7e4a88b7ccc047ce34ae8ae99492d46b1acf341a>`__).


Version 1.6.2 (Oct 3, 2023)
---------------------------

* Added a missing include file used by the new intrusive reference counting
  sample implementation from v1.6.0. (commit `31d115
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/31d115fce310475fed0f539b9446cc41ba9ff4d4>`__).

Version 1.6.1 (Oct 2, 2023)
---------------------------

* Added missing namespace declaration to the :cpp:class:`ref` intrusive
  reference counting RAII helper class added in version 1.6.0. (commit `3ba352
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/3ba3522e99c8f1f4bcc7c172abd2006eeaa8eaf8>`__).


Version 1.6.0 (Oct 2, 2023)
---------------------------

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Several :cpp:class:`nb::ndarray\<..\> <ndarray>` improvements:

  1. CPU loops involving nanobind ndarrays weren't getting properly vectorized.
     This release of nanobind adds *views*, which provide an efficient
     abstraction that enables better code generation. See the documentation
     section on :ref:`array views <ndarray-views>` for details.
     (commit `8f602e
     <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/8f602e187b0634e1df13ba370352cf092e9042c0>`__).

  2. Added support for nonstandard arithmetic types (e.g., ``__int128`` or
     ``__fp16``) in ndarrays. See the :ref:`documentation section
     <ndarray-nonstandard>` for details. (commit `49eab2
     <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/49eab2845530f84a1f029c5c1c5541ab3c1f9adc>`__).

  3. Shape constraints like :py:class:`nb::shape\<nb::any, nb::any, nb::any\>
     <shape>` are tedious to write. Now, there is a shorter form:
     :py:class:`nb::ndim\<3\> <ndim>`. (commit `1350a5
     <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/1350a5e15b28e80ffc2130a779f3b8c559ddb620>`__).

  4. Added an explicit constructor that can be used to add or remove ndarray
     constraints. (commit `a1ac207
     <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/a1ac207ab82206b8e50fe456f577c02270014fb3>`__).

* Added the wrapper class :cpp:class:`nb::weakref <weakref>`. (commit `78887f
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/78887fc167196a7568a5cef8f8dfbbee09aa7dc4>`__).

* Added the methods :cpp:func:`nb::dict::contains() <dict::contains>` and
  :cpp:func:`nb::mapping::contains() <mapping::contains>` to the Python type
  wrappers. (commit `64d87a
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/64d87ae01355c247123613f140cef8e71bc98fc7>`__).

* Added :cpp:func:`nb::exec() <exec>` and :cpp:func:`nb:eval() <eval>`. (PR `#299
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/299>`__).

* Added a type caster for ``std::complex<T>``. (PR `#292
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/292>`__, commit `dcbed4
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/dcbed4fe1500383ad1f4dff47cacbf0f2e6b1d3f>`__).

* Added an officially supported sample implementation of :ref:`intrusive
  reference counting <intrusive>` via the :cpp:class:`intrusive_counter`
  :cpp:class:`intrusive_base`, and :cpp:class:`ref` classes. (commit `3fa1af
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/3fa1af5e9e6fd0b08d13e16bb425a18963854829>`__).

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

* Fixed a serious issue involving combinations of bound types (e.g., ``T``) and
  type casters (e.g., ``std::vector<T>``), where nanobind was too aggressive in
  its use of *move semantics*. Calling a bound function from Python taking such
  a list (e.g., ``f([t1, t2, ..])``) would destruct ``t1, t2, ..`` if the type
  ``T`` exposed a move constructor, which is highly non-intuitive and no
  longer happens as of this fix.

  Further investigation also revealed inefficiencies in the previous
  implementation where moves were actually possible but not done (e.g., for
  functions taking an STL vector by value). Some binding projects may see
  speedups as a consequence of this change. (issue `#307
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/issues/307>`__, commit `122015
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/1220156961ce2d0c96a525f3c27b88e824b997ce>`__).


Version 1.5.2 (Aug 24, 2023)
----------------------------

* Fixed a severe issue with inheritance of the ``Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC`` flag
  affecting classes that derive from other classes with a
  :cpp:class:`nb::dynamic_attr <dynamic_attr>` annotation. (issue `#279
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/issues/279>`__, commit `dbedad
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/dbedadc294a7529bf401f01dbc97d4b47b677bc9>`__).
* Implicit conversion of nd-arrays to conform to contiguity constraints such as
  :cpp:class:`c_contig` and :cpp:class:`f_contig` previously failed in some
  cases that are now addressed. (issue `#278
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/issues/278>`__ commit `ed929b
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/ed929b7c6789e7d5e1760d515bc23ce6f7cedf8c>`__).

Version 1.5.1 (Aug 23, 2023)
----------------------------

* Fixed serious reference counting issue introduced in nanobind version 1.5.0,
  which affected the functions :cpp:func:`python_error::traceback()` and
  :cpp:func:`python_error::what()`, causing undefined behavior via
  use-after-free. Also addressed an unrelated minor UB sanitizer warning.
  (issue `#277 <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/issues/277>`__, commits
  `30d30c
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/30d30caaa3e834122944b28833b9c0315ef19a5d>`__
  and `c48b18
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/c48b180834b4929f2f77ce658f2a50ee78482fb7>`__).
* Extended the internal data structure tag so that it isolates different MSVC
  versions from each other (they are often not ABI compatible, see pybind11
  issue `#4779 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/pull/4779>`__). This means
  that nanobind 1.5.1 effectively bumps the ABI version to "10.5" when
  compiling for MSVC, and the internals will be isolated from extensions built
  with nanobind v1.5.0 or older. (commit `c7f3cd
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/c7f3cd6a7023dec55c63b995ba50c9f5d4b9147a>`__).
* Incorporated fixes so that nanobind works with PyPy 3.10. (commits `fb5508
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/fb5508955e1b1455adfe1372b49748ba706b4d87>`__
  and `2ed10a
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/2ed108a73bd5fbe0e1c43a8db07e40a165fc265f>`__).
* Fixed type caster for ``std::vector<bool>``. (PR `#256
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/256>`__).
* Fixed compilation in debug mode on MSVC. (PR `#253
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/253>`__).

Version 1.5.0 (Aug 7, 2023)
---------------------------

* Support for creating :ref:`chained exceptions <exception_chaining>` via the
  :cpp:func:`nb::raise_from() <chain_error>` and :cpp:func:`nb::chain_error()
  <chain_error>` functions. (commits `041520
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/0415208e83885dba038516d86c2f4cca5f81df5f>`__
  and `beb699
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/beb6999b7ce92ba5e3aaea60cd7f2acc9ba3cdc3>`__).
* Many improvements to the handling of return value policies in
  :cpp:class:`nb::ndarray\<..\> <ndarray>` to avoid unnecessary copies. (commit `ffd22b
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/ffd22b069ba95a546baeca0bdb6711fb9059cad8>`__,
  `a79575
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/a79575165134c72c0a26e46772290d0404eae7a3>`__,
  and `6f0c3f
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/6f0c3feaf088e78c75f2abee90164f20446eba08>`__).
* The :cpp:class:`nb::ndarray\<..\> <ndarray>` class now has an additional
  convenience constructor that takes the shape and (optionally) strides using
  ``std::initializer_list``. (commit `de1117
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/de111766b21fe893a41cd4614a346b0da251f7f2>`__).
* Added a non-throwing function :cpp:func:`nb::try_cast() <try_cast>` as an
  alternative to :cpp:func:`nb::cast() <cast>`. (commit `6ca852
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/6ca852cc881ee7cd35b674135030709a6b57b8f6>`__).
* The ``nb::list`` and ``nb::tuple`` default constructors now construct an empty list/tuple instead
  of an invalid null-initialized handle.
  (commit `506185 <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/506185dca821c9cc1268c33b4cc867ae20f0fc4b>`__)
* New low-level interface for wrapping existing C++ instances via
  :cpp:func:`nb::inst_take_ownership() <inst_take_ownership>`
  :cpp:func:`nb::inst_reference() <inst_reference>`. Also added convenience
  functions to replace the contents of an instance with that of another.
  :cpp:func:`nb::inst_replace_copy() <inst_replace_copy>` along with
  :cpp:func:`nb::inst_replace_move() <inst_replace_move>` (commit `1c462d
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/1c462d6e3a112e49686acf33c9cb6e34f996dd6b>`__).
* Added a low-level abstraction around :cpp:func:`nb::type_get_slot()
  <type_get_slot>` around ``PyType_GetSlot``, but with more consistent behavior
  across Python versions. (commit `d555e9
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/d555e9de1c45394f5be5d62dc999c603d651c8c4>`__).
* The :cpp:func:`nb::list::append() <list::append>` method now performs perfect
  forwarding. (commit `2219d0
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/2219d0b0fec5e6cc4fce96bc3dbad6bfa148a57d>`__).
* Inference of ``automatic*`` return value policy was entirely moved to the
  base C++ class type caster. (commit `1ff9df
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/1ff9df03fb56a16f56854b4cecd1f388f73d3b53>`__).
* Switch to the new Python 3.12 error status API if available. (commit `36751c
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/36751cb05994a96a3801bf511c846a7bc68e2f09>`__).
* Various minor fixes and improvements.
* ABI version 10.

Version 1.4.0 (June 8, 2023)
----------------------------

* Improved the efficiency of the function dispatch loop. (PR `#227
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/227>`__).
* Significant improvements to the Eigen type casters (generalized stride
  handling to avoid unnecessary copies, support for conversion via
  ``nb::cast()``, many refinements to the  ``Eigen::Ref<T>`` interface). (PR
  `#215 <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/215>`__).
* Added a ``NB_DOMAIN`` parameter to :cmake:command:`nanobind_add_module` which
  can isolate extensions from each other to avoid binding clashes. See the
  associated :ref:`FAQ entry <type-visibility>` for details. (commit `977119
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/977119c4797db7decf8064cf118afde768ff8fab>`__).
* Reduced the severity of nanobind encountering a duplicate type binding
  (commits `f3b0e6

  (PR `#224 <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/224>`__).
* Fixed compilation on PyPy 3.8. (commit `cd8135
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/cd8135baa1da1213252272b5c9ecbf909e947597>`__).
* Reduced binary bloat of musllinux wheels. (commit `f52513
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/f525139a80d173feaea5518e842aceeb6ceec5cf>`__).

Version 1.3.1 (May 31, 2023)
----------------------------

* CMake build system improvements for stable ABI wheel generation.
  (PR `#222 <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/222>`__).

Version 1.3.0 (May 31, 2023)
----------------------------

This is a big release. The sections below cover added features, efficiency
improvements, and miscellaneous fixes and improvements.

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* nanobind now supports binding types that inherit from
  ``std::enable_shared_from_this<T>``. See the :ref:`advanced section
  on object ownership <enable_shared_from_this>` for more details.
  (PR `#212 <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/212>`__).
* Added a type caster between Python ``datetime``/``timedelta`` objects and
  C++ ``std::chrono::duration``/``std::chrono::time_point``, ported
  from pybind11. (PR `#175 <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/175>`__).
* The :cpp:class:`nb::ndarray\<..\> <ndarray>` class can now use the buffer
  protocol to receive and return arrays representing read-only memory. (PR
  `#217 <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/217>`__).
* Added :cpp:func:`nb::python_error::discard_as_unraisable()
  <python_error::discard_as_unraisable>` as a wrapper around
  ``PyErr_WriteUnraisable()``. (PR `#175
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/175>`__).

Efficiency improvements:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Reduced the per-instance overhead of nanobind by 1 pointer and simplified the
  internal hash table types to crunch ``libnanobind``. (commit `de018d
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/de018db2d17905564703f1ade4aa201a22f8551f>`__).
* Supplemental type data specified via :cpp:class:`nb::supplement\<T\>()
  <supplement>` is now stored directly within the type object instead of being
  referenced through an indirection. (commit `d82ca9
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/d82ca9c14191e74dd35dd5bf15fc90f5230319fb>`__).
* Reduced the number of exception-related exports to further crunch
  ``libnanobind``. (commit `763962
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/763962b8ce76414148089ef6a68cff97d7cc66ce>`__).
* Reduced the size of nanobind type objects by 5 pointers. (PR `#194
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/194>`__, `#195
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/195>`__, and commit `d82ca9
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/d82ca9c14191e74dd35dd5bf15fc90f5230319fb>`__).
* Internal nanobind types (``nb_type``, ``nb_static_property``, ``nb_ndarray``)
  are now constructed on demand. This reduces the size of the ``libnanobind``
  component in static (``NB_STATIC``) builds when those features are not used.

  builds. (commit `f0f4aa
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/f0f42a564995ba3bd573282674d1a6d636a048c8>`__).

  especially in ``NB_STATIC`` builds. (commit `5ead9f
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/5ead9ff348a2ef0df8231e6480607a5b0623a16b>`__)
* nanobind enums now take advantage of :ref:`supplemental data <supplement>`
  to improve the speed of object and name lookups. Note that this prevents
  use of ``nb::supplement<T>()`` with enums for other purposes.
  (PR `#195 <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/195>`__).

Miscellaneous fixes and improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Use the new `PEP-697 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0697/>`__ interface to
  access data in type objects when compiling stable ABI3 wheels. This improves
  forward compatibility (the Python team may at some point significantly
  refactor the layout and internals of type objects). (PR `#211
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/211>`__):
* Added introspection attributes ``__self__`` and ``__func__`` to nanobind
  bound methods, to make them more like regular Python bound methods.
  Fixed a bug where ``some_obj.method.__call__()`` would behave differently
  than ``some_obj.method()``.
  (PR `#216 <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/216>`__).
* Updated the implementation of :cpp:class:`nb::enum_ <enum_>` so it does
  not take advantage of any private nanobind type details. As a side effect,
  the construct ``nb::class_<T>(..., nb::is_enum(...))`` is no longer permitted;
  use ``nb::enum_<T>(...)`` instead.
  (PR `#195 <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/195>`__).
* Added the :cpp:class:`nb::type_slots_callback` class binding annotation,
  similar to :cpp:class:`nb::type_slots` but allowing more dynamic choices.
  (PR `#195 <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/195>`__).
* nanobind type objects now treat attributes specially whose names
  begin with ``@``. These attributes can be set once, but not
  rebound or deleted.  This safeguard allows a borrowed reference to
  the attribute value to be safely stashed in the type supplement,
  allowing arbitrary Python data associated with the type to be accessed
  without a dictionary lookup while keeping this data visible to the
  garbage collector.  (PR `#195 <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/195>`__).
* Fixed surprising behavior in enumeration comparisons and arithmetic
  (PR `#207 <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/pull/207>`__):

  * Enum equality comparisons (``==`` and ``!=``) now can only be true
    if both operands have the same enum type, or if one is an enum and
    the other is an :py:class:`int`. This resolves some confusing
    results and ensures that enumerators of different types have a
    distinct identity, which is important if they're being put into
    the same set or used as keys in the same dictionary. All of the
    following were previously true but will now evaluate as false:

    * ``FooEnum(1) == BarEnum(1)``
    * ``FooEnum(1) == 1.2``
    * ``FooEnum(1) == "1"``

  * Enum ordering comparisons (``<``, ``<=``, ``>=``, ``>``) and
    arithmetic operations (when using the :cpp:struct:`is_arithmetic`
    annotation) now require that any non-enum operand be a Python number
    (an object that defines ``__int__``, ``__float__``, and/or ``__index__``)
    and will avoid truncating non-integer operands to integers. Note that
    unlike with equality comparisons, ordering and arithmetic operations
    *do* still permit two operands that are enums of different types.
    Some examples of changed behavior:

    * ``FooEnum(1) < 1.2`` is now true (used to be false)
    * ``FooEnum(2) * 1.5`` is now 3.0 (used to be 2)
    * ``FooEnum(3) - "2"`` now raises an exception (used to be 1)

  * Enum comparisons and arithmetic operations with unsupported types
    now return `NotImplemented` rather than raising an exception.
    This means equality comparisons such as ``some_enum == None`` will
    return unequal rather than failing; order comparisons such as
    ``some_enum < None`` will still fail, but now with a more
    informative error.

* ABI version 8.

* The documentation process revealed a number of inconsistencies in the
  :cpp:func:`class_\<T\>::def* <class_::def>` naming scheme. nanobind will from
  now on use the following shortened and more logical interface:

  .. list-table::
    :widths: 40 60
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Type
      - method
    * - Methods & constructors
      - :cpp:func:`.def() <class_::def>`
    * - Fields
      - :cpp:func:`.def_ro() <class_::def_ro>`,
        :cpp:func:`.def_rw() <class_::def_rw>`
    * - Properties
      - :cpp:func:`.def_prop_ro() <class_::def_prop_ro>`,
        :cpp:func:`.def_prop_rw() <class_::def_prop_rw>`
    * - Static methods
      - :cpp:func:`.def_static() <class_::def_static>`
    * - Static fields
      - :cpp:func:`.def_ro_static() <class_::def_ro_static>`,
        :cpp:func:`.def_rw_static() <class_::def_rw_static>`
    * - Static properties

        :cpp:func:`.def_prop_rw_static() <class_::def_prop_rw_static>`

  Compatibility wrappers with deprecation warnings were also added to help port
  existing code. They will be removed when nanobind reaches version 1.0.
  (commits `cb0dc3
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/cb0dc392b656fd9d0c85c56dc51a9be1de06e176>`__
  and `b5ed96
  <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/commit/b5ed696a7a68c9c9adc4d3aa3c6f4adb5b7defeb>`__)
* The ``nb::tensor<..>`` class has been renamed to :cpp:class:`nb::ndarray\<..\> <ndarray>`,
  and it is now located in a different header file (``nanobind/ndarray.h``). A
  compatibility wrappers with a deprecation warning was retained in the
  original header file. It will be removed when nanobind reaches version 1.0.
